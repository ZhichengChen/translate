Working with sub-projects
=========================

A complex project is not necessarily composed of a single Play
application. You may want to split a large project into several smaller
applications, or even extract some logic into a standard Java or Scala
library that has nothing to do with a Play application.

It will be helpful to read the [SBT documentation on multi-project
builds](http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Multi-Project).
Sub-projects do not have their own build file, but share the parent
project’s build file.

Adding a simple library sub-project
-----------------------------------

You can make your application depend on a simple library project. Just
add another sbt project definition in your `project/Build.scala` build
file:

    import sbt._
    import Keys._
    import play.Project._

    object ApplicationBuild extends Build {

      val appName         = "my-first-application"
      val appVersion      = "1.0"

      val appDependencies = Seq(
        //if it's a java project add javaCore, javaJdbc, jdbc etc.
      )
      
      val mySubProject = Project("my-library", file("myLibrary"))

      val main = play.Project(
        appName, appVersion, appDependencies, path = file("myProject")
      ).dependsOn(mySubProject)


    }

Here we have defined a sub-project in the application’s `myLibrary`
folder. This sub-project is a standard sbt project, using the default
layout:

    myProject
     └ app
     └ conf
     └ public
    myLibrary
     └ src
        └ main
           └ java
           └ scala
    project
     └ Build.scala

When you have a sub-project enabled in your build, you can focus on this
project and compile, test or run it individually. Just use the
`projects` command in the Play console prompt to display all projects:


    [my-first-application] $ projects
    [info] In file:/Volumes/Data/gbo/myFirstApp/
    [info]   * my-first-application
    [info]     my-library


The default project is the one whose variable name comes first
alphabetically. You may make your main project by making its variable
name aaaMain. To change the current project use the `project` command:

    [my-first-application] $ project my-library
    [info] Set current project to my-library

When you run your Play application in dev mode, the dependent projects
are automatically recompiled, and if something cannot compile you will
see the result in your browser:

Splitting your web application into several parts
-------------------------------------------------

As a Play application is just a standard sbt project with a default
configuration, it can depend on another Play application.

The configuration is very close to the previous one. Simply configure
your sub-project as a `play.Project`:

    import sbt._
    import Keys._
    import play.Project._

    object ApplicationBuild extends Build {

      val appName = "zenexity.com"
      val appVersion = "1.2"

      val common = play.Project(
        appName + "-common", appVersion, path = file("common")
      )
      
      val website = play.Project(
        appName + "-website", appVersion, path = file("website")
      ).dependsOn(common)
      
      val adminArea = play.Project(
        appName + "-admin", appVersion, path = file("admin")
      ).dependsOn(common)
      
      val main = play.Project(
        appName, appVersion, path = file("main")
      ).dependsOn(
        website, adminArea
      )
    }

Here we define a complete project split in two main parts: the website
and the admin area. Moreover these two parts depend themselves on a
common module.

If you would like the dependent projects to be recompiled and tested
when you recompile and test the main project then you will need to add
an “aggregate” clause.

    val main = PlayProject(
      appName, appVersion
    ).dependsOn(
      website, adminArea
    ).aggregate(
      website, adminArea
    )

> Note: in order to avoid naming collision, make sure your controllers,
> including the Assets controller in your subprojects are using a
> different name space than the main project

Splitting the route file
------------------------

As of `play 2.1` it’s also possible to split the route file into smaller
pieces. This is a very handy feature if you want to create a robust,
reusable multi-module play application

### Consider the following build file

`project/Build.scala`:

    import sbt._
    import Keys._
    import play.Project._
    object ApplicationBuild extends Build {
    val appName         = "myproject"
    val appVersion      = "1.0-SNAPSHOT"
    val adminDeps = Seq(
      // Add your project dependencies here,
       "mysql" % "mysql-connector-java" % "5.1.18",
      jdbc,
      anorm
    )
    val mainDeps = Seq()
    lazy val admin = play.Project(appName + "-admin", appVersion, adminDeps, path = file("modules/admin"))
    lazy  val main = play.Project(appName, appVersion, mainDeps).settings(
      // Add your own project settings here      
    ).dependsOn(admin).aggregate(admin)

}

### project structure

    app
      └ controllers
      └ models
      └ views
    conf
      └ application.conf
      └ routes
    modules
      └ admin
        └ conf/admin.routes
        └ app/controllers
        └ app/models
        └ app/views     
    project
     └ build.properties
     └ Build.scala
     └ plugins.sbt

> Note: there is only a single instance of `application.conf`. Also, the
> route file in `admin` is called `admin.routes`

`conf/routes`:


    GET /index                          controllers.Application.index()
  ->  /admin admin.Routes
    GET     /assets/*file               controllers.Assets.at(path="/public", file)


`modules/admin/conf/admin.routes`:


    GET /index                           controllers.admin.Application.index()
    GET     /assets/*file               controllers.admin.Assets.at(path="/public", file)

### Assets and controller classes should be all defined in the `controllers.admin` package

`modules/admin/controllers/Assets.scala`:

    package controllers.admin
    object Assets extends controllers.AssetsBuilder

> Note: Java users can do something very similar i.e.

    // Assets.java
    package controllers.my;
    public class Assets {
    //can be referenced as `controllers.my.Assets.delegate.at` in the route file
    public static controllers.AssetsBuilder delegate = new controllers.AssetsBuilder();
    }

and a controller:

`modules/admin/controllers/Application.scala`:

    package controllers.admin

    import play.api._
    import play.api.mvc._
    import views.html._

    object Application extends Controller {

      def index = Action { implicit request =>
        Ok("admin")
      }
    }

### Reverse routing in `admin`

in case of a regular controller call:

    controllers.admin.routes.Application.index

and for `Assets`:

    controllers.admin.routes.Assets.at("...")

### Through the browser


    http://localhost:9000/index

triggers

    controllers.Application.index

and

    http://localhost:9000/admin/index

triggers

    controllers.admin.Application.index
